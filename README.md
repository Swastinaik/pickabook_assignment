# PickaBook Assignment

Hello i'm Swasti Santosh Naik i have developed this project according to the given task.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend : Next.js
- Backend : FastAPI
- Image storage : ImagekitIO
- AI model : Google gemini

### Workflow
1. First user uploads the image of child or any other image which has a clear face with a preview along with prompt for desired image.
2. Then the request is sent from frontend to backend which first validates the user input and further processes.
3. The backend calls the Gemini API with image and the prompt, Then the Gemini generates the image according to the given prompt.
4. The backend then stores the image into the ImagekitIO and sends the url of the image to frontend.
5. The frontend shows the image generated by the Gemini to the user.

### Flow Chart

### Model Choice
My initial preference was to use the InstantID API from Replicate. However, since accessing the resource required a card and I did not have access to mine at the time, I was unable to proceed.
Subsequently, I attempted to implement the InstantX model on Hugging Face via the Gradio client, but due to the unavailability of inference support, this approach was not feasible.
Finally, I opted for the Gemini model, which is recognized as a state-of-the-art solution for image generation.

### Limitations
- control : Although the Gemini model gives control using prompt but using models like InstatntID provided more control especially when it's related to face.
- Tokens and limited free tier : The Gemini api offers state of the art model with generous tier but still it would reach limit when used in scale.

### Improvements in v2
- Adding the InstantID models via replicate if have access.
- provide more control to user like providing the varieties of templates.
- Use ControlNet or custom diffusion pipelines to blend the stylised face seamlessly into the illustration background.
- Move from single-instance deployment to containerised microservices (Docker + Kubernetes/ECS) for better scaling.
